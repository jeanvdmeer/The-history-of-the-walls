# The-history-of-the-walls
Implementation tool for the Master Thesis presented to TU/e about updating outdated IFC files based on segmented point cloud geometry. The focus are walls, ceilings and columns, following a Manhattan World assumption. Ceilings are updated by having their elevation updated, and columns and walls have their position and quantity updated.

The functionalities can be accessed through the user interface ( userInterface.py ). Python 3.10 was used for the development of the code. An Anaconda environment was used to run the code and install the necessary libraries but there are of course other possibilities to run the tool. Packages used and installed include IfcOpenShell, pythonOCC numpy, pandas, PyQt5, datetime, openpyxl, alphashape, mpl_toolkits, shapely, matplotlib and math.
